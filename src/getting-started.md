## Setting Up {#setup}
After inviting Sessions Bot to a new Discord Server it will send a greeting/how-to setup message in any available text/chat channel.

If no text channel is available, the bot will then try to send the greeting via dm to the inviting user or server owner.

If for some reason the greeting message is unavailable, don't worry!
You can simply finish bot setup by taking either of the following steps:

**Option 1:**
1. Use the `/setup` command inside your Discord Server

### Follow Setup Instructions
This greeting message *(as well as [`/setup`](./commands.md#setup))* directs the user to the [Sessions Bot's website](https://sessionsbot.fyi) to begin the bot setup process for the server.
