## Inviting the Bot {#invite}
You can invite Sessions Bot via 2 options:

 - <del>Search for **Sessions Bot** within Discord's Application Marketplace.</del> <i>(currently unavailable)</i>

## Setting Up {#setup}
After inviting Sessions Bot to a new Discord Server it will attempt to send a 'greeting' message in any available text/chat channel.

If no text channel is available, the bot will then try to send the greeting via dm to the inviting user or server owner.

This greeting message directs the user to the [SessionsBot's website](https://sessionsbot.fyi) to begin the bot setup process for the new server.

::: details Don't see your greeting message?
If for some reason the greeting message is unavailable, don't worry!
You can simply finish bot setup by taking the following steps:

1. Visit [SessionsBot's Website](https://sessionsbot.fyi).
2. Sign in using Discord.
3. View your [Dashboard](https://sessionsbot.fyi/dashboard).
4. Select the server you wish to configure.
5. Follow prompts for setup. ðŸŽ‰

### Follow Setup Instructions
Once you've entered the setup panel for the bot, complete prompts/forms as described.
